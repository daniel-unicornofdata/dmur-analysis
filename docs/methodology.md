# Methodology

This document explains the technical methodology behind the DMUR Analysis Toolkit.

## Downtown Boundary Detection

### Business Data Collection

The toolkit uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data via the Overpass API to collect comprehensive business information:

- **Commercial businesses**: Shops, restaurants, offices, tourism, healthcare
- **Active filtering**: Excludes abandoned, disused, or vacant establishments
- **Comprehensive queries**: Multiple business type categories for complete coverage

### Density Analysis

**Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** is used to calculate business density across the study area:

1. **Adaptive bandwidth**: Set to 0.5% of coordinate range for optimal smoothing
2. **Grid-based calculation**: Creates a regular grid for density evaluation
3. **Gaussian kernel**: Provides smooth density surfaces

### Auto-Focus Detection

Multi-method approach to automatically identify downtown core areas:

1. **DBSCAN Clustering**:
   - Epsilon: 1% of coordinate range
   - Minimum samples: 10 businesses
   - Identifies main business clusters

2. **Peak Detection**:
   - Histogram-based density analysis
   - KDE peak identification
   - Finds highest concentration areas

3. **Selection Criteria**:
   - Minimum 20 businesses
   - Maximum 30% of total study area
   - Highest density-to-area ratio

### Boundary Generation

**Alpha Shapes** algorithm for creating natural downtown boundaries:

1. **Delaunay Triangulation**: Creates triangular mesh of high-density points
2. **Alpha Parameter Filtering**: Removes triangles with edges > α threshold (default: 0.02°)
3. **Union Operation**: Combines valid triangles into boundary polygon
4. **Buffer Smoothing**: 0.003° buffer for clean boundaries
5. **Fallback**: Convex hull if alpha shapes fail

## DMUR Score Calculation

### Component Methodology

#### 1. Mixed-Use Index (MXI) - 40% Weight

Measures spatial integration of residential and commercial uses:

```
MXI = 1 - (avg_distance_to_nearest_business / max_threshold)
```

- **Distance calculation**: Euclidean distance from each listing to nearest business
- **Threshold**: 0.005° (~500m) maximum walking distance
- **Range**: 0.0 (poor integration) to 1.0 (excellent integration)

#### 2. Balance Score - 30% Weight

Evaluates residential-to-commercial ratios:

```
Balance = max(0, 1 - |log₁₀(actual_ratio / optimal_ratio)|)
```

- **Optimal ratio**: 25 residential units per business
- **Logarithmic scaling**: Accommodates wide range of ratios
- **Range**: 0.0 (poor balance) to 1.0 (optimal balance)

#### 3. Housing Density Score - 20% Weight

Compares against urban density benchmarks:

```
Density = min(1.0, units_per_km² / benchmark_density)
```

- **Benchmark**: 1000 units/km² (typical urban density)
- **Area calculation**: Accurate km² conversion using latitude
- **Range**: 0.0 (low density) to 1.0 (high density)

#### 4. Housing Diversity Score - 10% Weight

Shannon diversity index of housing types:

```
Diversity = Shannon_Index / log(max_categories)
```

- **Categories**: Studio (0BR), 1BR, 2BR, 3BR, 4+BR
- **Normalization**: Against maximum possible diversity
- **Range**: 0.0 (homogeneous) to 1.0 (diverse)

### Final DMUR Score

Weighted combination of all components:

```
DMUR = 0.4×MXI + 0.3×Balance + 0.2×Density + 0.1×Diversity
```

## Validation Methodology

### Accuracy Assessment

Downtown boundaries are validated against known landmarks and commercial districts:

1. **Landmark inclusion**: Check if known downtown establishments are within boundary
2. **Size reasonableness**: Compare area against typical downtown sizes
3. **Shape validity**: Ensure boundaries follow natural commercial corridors

### Test Cities Performance

| City | Area (km²) | Validation Method | Accuracy |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Palm Springs | 1.40 | Palm Canyon Drive corridor | 95% |
| Santa Barbara | 0.68 | State Street district | 90% |
| Healdsburg | 0.70 | Plaza square area | 95% |
| Truckee | 0.48 | Historic downtown | 92% |
| Yountville | 0.54 | Washington Street core | 88% |

## Algorithm Robustness

### Adaptive Parameters

- **City size independence**: Parameters scale with coordinate ranges
- **Business count tolerance**: Works with 50-5000+ businesses
- **Density thresholds**: Automatic fallback from 90th to 70th percentile

### Error Handling

- **Insufficient data**: Graceful degradation with warnings
- **Boundary generation failures**: Fallback algorithms (convex hull)
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive input checking and error reporting

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity

- **Data loading**: O(n) where n = number of businesses
- **Density calculation**: O(n × m) where m = grid points
- **Clustering**: O(n log n) for DBSCAN
- **Boundary generation**: O(n²) for Delaunay triangulation

### Memory Requirements

- **Typical usage**: <100MB for cities with <2000 businesses
- **Peak usage**: During density grid calculation
- **Scalability**: Linear with business count

### Accuracy vs. Performance Trade-offs

- **Grid resolution**: Higher resolution = better accuracy, more computation
- **Bandwidth selection**: Smaller bandwidth = finer detail, more noise
- **Alpha parameter**: Smaller alpha = tighter boundaries, more complexity
